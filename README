This contain my solutions to the exercises found in The Scheme Programming
Language, 4th Edition [http://www.scheme.com/tspl4.html]

The solutions were tested using Petite Chez Scheme v8,3 [http://www.scheme.com/download/]
and guile v2.0.2 [http://www.gnu.org/s/guile/]

The solutions are licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.

The code is organized by chapter and exercise number. For example, the
code for the solution to exercise 2.42 in chapter 2 is contained in
the file named ex2.42.scm in the chap2/ subdirectory.

This is a work-in-progress.
